# Last round

last round is chosen randomly in a scale (see config)

# Idea for third part

* Instead of using one update mechanism per simulation, maybe uses multiple
update mechanism, and each player has preferences between update mechanism
to play in different situation

* Simultaneous play, chances moves etc

* Hydra jobs
